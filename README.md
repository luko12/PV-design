# PV-design
63MWdc solar farm design in Shoreham, NY (Long Island)

This project explores the PV design process using commercially popular software PVCase Ground Mount (an add-in for AutoDesk AutoCAD) as well as PVSyst (standalone application). In this project, I designed and simulated a 63MWdc, 58MWac solar farm using First Solar modules.

Note- DWG from PVCase is too big to host on Github
